Project Title:Time Series Forecasting Using ARIMA, Linear Regression, and XGBoost.

Developed a time series forecasting model to predict demand using lag-based features. Conducted a comparative analysis between classical ARIMA and machine learning models (Linear Regression, XGBoost). Evaluated models using RMSE and RÂ² metrics, visualized prediction performance, and generated 10-step future forecasts. Demonstrated expertise in temporal data preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation.
